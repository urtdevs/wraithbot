#
# This is the list of ts3 servers that the bot can query
#
# client_port is what you use to connect with the GUI
# query_port is the server instance specific port
#            used for the Server Query protocol
#
# You need these permissions in order to use it:
#
# In the GUI, Permissions -> Server Groups -> Guest
# Under Virtual Server -> Information, add these:
#    view server info
#    view server connection info (really needed?)
#    view existing channels
#    view list of clients online
#
# You can use telnet to view the output interactively.
# Here's an example with iCu's TS3.  The parts in [[...]]
# were my input.
#
# host$ [[telnet 173.45.231.242 10011]]
# Trying 173.45.231.242...
# Connected to 173.45.231.242.
# Escape character is '^]'.

# Welcome to the TeamSpeak 3 ServerQuery interface, type "help" for a list of commands and "help <command>" for information on a specific command.
# [[use port=9987]]
# error id=0 msg=ok
# [[clientlist]]
# ... list of clients here (omitted)
# error id=0 msg=ok
# [[quit]]
# error id=0 msg=ok
# Connection closed by foreign host.

# If you get an error message about invalid permissions, tell the server admin
# to see the toplevel README in this project.  It shows the necessary permissions.
#
# The default query port is 10011.  For gameservers.com, it is 9100.
