# List of clans.  This file has a strict structure due to the regex.
# This is not intended to be exhaustive so don't be offended if your
# clan isn't listed here. :)  It is supposed to be mid to top tier
# clans.  This list is used to report out whether it is a good pub or not.
#
# The euro clan list is very sparse right now because I don't play in
# Clanbase so I don't know who to add.
#
# clan name <one or more tabs> <regex>
#
# Assume the regex is wrapped with:   qr{regex}xms
# Clan names can't have tabs so that's why there can be more than one
